# Rust-based OpenMP/OpenACC Unified Parser (ROUP) 
ROUP is a standalone, unified parser for OpenMP and OpenACC, developed using Rust. It is designed as an extensible framework that can be expanded to support additional directive-based programming interfaces. For each language, ROUP provides a unique set of grammars and intermediate representations (IRs).
