# Learning Rust: External Dependencies
# =====================================
# Cargo makes it easy to use external crates (libraries)
# nom = parser combinator library for building parsers
# Version 8.0.0 uses semantic versioning
nom = "8.0.0"

# FFI layer dependencies (100% safe Rust)
once_cell = "1"     # Lazy static initialization
parking_lot = "0.12" # Faster Mutex than std

# Robust Rust AST parser (used by both build.rs and `gen` binary for header validation)
syn = { version = "2", features = ["full", "parsing"] }

[dev-dependencies]
# Test-only dependencies
serial_test = "3.0" # Serialize tests that share global state
criterion = "0.5"   # Benchmarking framework

[build-dependencies]
# Build script dependencies (build.rs only) - syn also in main dependencies for `gen` binary
