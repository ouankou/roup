# OpenMP Support Summary

ROUP tracks directive and clause keywords from OpenMP 3.0 through 6.0. Coverage details, including language specific notes and the
full directive–clause matrix, live in the mdBook documentation:

- [Directive catalogue](../docs/book/src/openmp60-directives-clauses.md)
- [Directive–clause component index](../docs/book/src/openmp60-directive-clause-components.md)
- [OpenMP support overview](../docs/book/src/openmp-support.md)

Those pages are generated from the same registries that back the parser, keeping the tables and source in sync. This file remains
as a lightweight pointer for contributors who are looking for the authoritative listings.
