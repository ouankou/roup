# Minimal Unsafe Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the minimal `unsafe` code added to enable C compatibility while maintaining maximum safety.

**Total unsafe blocks:** 11 (across 2 files)  
**Total unsafe lines:** ~20 lines out of ~8,000 lines of code (0.25%)  
**Safety:** All unsafe blocks are well-documented with safety contracts

---

## Unsafe Blocks Breakdown

### 1. `src/ffi/parse.rs` - 2 unsafe blocks

#### Block 1: Reading C String (line 642)
```rust
let rust_str = unsafe {
    match CStr::from_ptr(input).to_str() {
        Ok(s) => s,
        Err(_) => return OmpStatus::InvalidUtf8,
    }
};
```

**Purpose:** Convert C string pointer to Rust &str  
**Safety Contract:**  
- Caller MUST ensure `input` points to valid null-terminated C string
- String must remain valid for duration of call
**Safety Checks:**  
- ✅ NULL check performed before unsafe block
- ✅ UTF-8 validation with error return
- ✅ No memory is written, only read

---

#### Block 2: Writing to Output Pointer (line 675)
```rust
unsafe {
    *out_handle = handle;
}
```

**Purpose:** Write parsed directive handle to output parameter  

**Why This Needs Unsafe:**

Same reason as the 9 directive query functions - C expects output pointers:

```c
// C code pattern (standard in all C libraries):
Handle directive;
OmpStatus status = omp_parse_cstr("#pragma omp parallel", OMP_LANG_C, &directive);
if (status != OMP_SUCCESS) {
    printf("Parse error: %d\n", status);
    return;
}
// directive now contains valid handle
```

**Why not return the Handle directly?**

This would lose error information:
```c
// WRONG - no way to handle errors:
Handle directive = omp_parse_cstr_bad("#pragma omp parallel", OMP_LANG_C);
// What if it failed? How do we know? There's no null Handle value!
```

**The output pointer pattern lets C separate status from value:**
- **Status code** tells if parsing succeeded
- **Output pointer** receives the value (only if status == OK)
- **Standard C practice** (used by `fopen()`, `stat()`, `pthread_create()`, etc.)

**Safety Contract:**  
- Caller MUST ensure `out_handle` points to valid, aligned, writable Handle
  
**Safety Checks:**  
- ✅ NULL check performed before unsafe block
- ✅ Only writes a u64 value (cannot corrupt memory)
- ✅ Single pointer write, no iteration

---

### 2. `src/ffi/directive.rs` - 9 unsafe blocks

All blocks follow the same pattern: write to output pointer after NULL check.

#### Block 3-11: Output Pointer Writes
```rust
// Example from omp_directive_kind_ptr
unsafe {
    *out_kind = kind;
}
```

**Functions with this pattern:**
1. `omp_directive_kind_ptr` (line 400)
2. `omp_directive_clause_count_ptr` (line 419)
3. `omp_directive_line_ptr` (line 438)
4. `omp_directive_column_ptr` (line 457)
5. `omp_directive_language_ptr` (line 479)
6. `omp_directive_clauses_cursor_ptr` (line 501)
7. `omp_cursor_has_next_ptr` (line 520)
8. `omp_cursor_position_ptr` (line 539)
9. `omp_cursor_total_ptr` (line 558)

**Purpose:** Write query results to C output pointers  

---

### Why Output Pointers Need Unsafe

**The Fundamental Problem:**

In C, functions return values through output pointers (this is standard C practice):
```c
// C code expects this pattern:
int32_t kind;
OmpStatus status = omp_directive_kind_ptr(directive, &kind);
if (status == OMP_SUCCESS) {
    printf("Kind: %d\n", kind);  // Value written through pointer
}
```

**Why Rust Requires Unsafe:**

Writing to a raw pointer (`*mut T`) is **inherently unsafe** in Rust because:

1. **No Ownership:** Rust cannot verify the pointer came from valid memory
2. **No Lifetime:** Rust cannot verify the memory hasn't been freed
3. **No Aliasing:** Rust cannot verify no other code is using this memory
4. **No Bounds:** Rust cannot verify the pointer isn't out of bounds

```rust
// This is ALWAYS unsafe in Rust - there's no safe way to do it:
*out_kind = kind;  // Writing through raw pointer
```

**Why We Can't Avoid It:**

We need output pointers because:

1. **C calling convention:** C expects to pass `&variable` and get values back
2. **Error handling:** C functions return status codes, not values
3. **Standard practice:** All C libraries use this pattern (libc, OpenSSL, SQLite, etc.)

**Example of what we're avoiding:**

Without output pointers, C would look like this (WRONG):
```c
// This doesn't work - can't return both status AND value
int32_t kind = omp_directive_kind(directive);  // Error handling lost!
// How do we know if it succeeded? -1 could be a valid enum value!
```

Or this (also WRONG):
```c
// This doesn't work - C doesn't have Option/Result types
struct Result { OmpStatus status; int32_t value; };
// Too complex, not standard C practice
```

**The Safe Alternative (Without Unsafe):**

We already have safe functions that return values directly:
```rust
// Existing safe API (returns -1 on error):
pub extern "C" fn omp_directive_kind(handle: Handle) -> i32 {
    // Returns -1 if error
}
```

**But this has problems for C users:**

```c
// C user's perspective:
int32_t kind = omp_directive_kind(directive);
if (kind == -1) {
    // Is this an error or is -1 a valid enum value?
    // We can't tell! No error context!
}
```

**The Pointer-Based API (With Minimal Unsafe):**

```rust
pub extern "C" fn omp_directive_kind_ptr(
    handle: Handle,
    out_kind: *mut i32,
) -> OmpStatus {
    if out_kind.is_null() {
        return OmpStatus::NullPointer;  // Safe error!
    }

    let kind = omp_directive_kind(handle);
    if kind < 0 {
        return OmpStatus::NotFound;  // Safe error!
    }

    // UNSAFE: Must use unsafe to write through pointer
    unsafe {
        *out_kind = kind;
    }

    OmpStatus::Ok
}
```

**C user's perspective (MUCH BETTER):**
```c
int32_t kind;
OmpStatus status = omp_directive_kind_ptr(directive, &kind);
if (status != OMP_SUCCESS) {
    // Clear error! We know exactly what went wrong
    printf("Error: %d\n", status);
    return;
}
// kind is guaranteed valid here
printf("Kind: %d\n", kind);
```

**Why Each Unsafe Block is Necessary:**

| Function | Why Output Pointer Needed |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `omp_directive_kind_ptr` | Return both status AND enum value |
| `omp_directive_clause_count_ptr` | Return both status AND count |
| `omp_directive_line_ptr` | Return both status AND line number |
| `omp_directive_column_ptr` | Return both status AND column number |
| `omp_directive_language_ptr` | Return both status AND language enum |
| `omp_directive_clauses_cursor_ptr` | Return both status AND cursor handle |
| `omp_cursor_has_next_ptr` | Return both status AND boolean |
| `omp_cursor_position_ptr` | Return both status AND position |
| `omp_cursor_total_ptr` | Return both status AND total count |

**Safety Contract:**  
- Caller MUST ensure output pointer is valid, aligned, and writable
  
**Safety Checks WE Perform:**  
- ✅ NULL check on every pointer before unsafe block
- ✅ Only writes primitive values (i32, u32, usize, Handle)
- ✅ Single write per function, no loops
- ✅ Values are computed safely before writing
- ✅ Return error codes instead of panicking

**What Could Go Wrong:**

1. **C passes invalid pointer** → Would crash
   - *Mitigation:* We check for NULL (catches most errors)
   - *Note:* Can't prevent all invalid pointers (same as all C FFI)

2. **C passes unaligned pointer** → Would crash on some architectures
   - *Mitigation:* We use standard types (natural alignment)
   - *Note:* Standard C practice, C compiler ensures alignment

3. **C has data race** → Undefined behavior
   - *Mitigation:* Documented in safety contract
   - *Note:* C caller's responsibility (same as any C library)

**This is Standard Rust FFI Practice:**

Every Rust library that provides C FFI has this same pattern:
- `libsodium` (cryptography): Output pointers for keys
- `SQLite` bindings: Output pointers for query results  
- `OpenSSL` bindings: Output pointers for crypto operations
- `libc` itself: Output pointers everywhere (`read()`, `stat()`, etc.)

**The unsafe is unavoidable for C compatibility.**

## Safety Analysis

### What Could Go Wrong?

#### Scenario 1: NULL Pointer
**Prevented by:** Explicit `is_null()` checks before every unsafe block  
**Result if check fails:** Returns `OmpStatus::NullPointer` safely

#### Scenario 2: Invalid/Dangling Pointer
**Cannot prevent:** This is caller's responsibility (part of FFI contract)  
**Mitigation:** Documented safety contracts, standard C FFI practice  
**Impact:** Same as any C FFI library

#### Scenario 3: Unaligned Pointer
**Cannot prevent:** This is caller's responsibility  
**Mitigation:** Using standard types (i32, u32, u64) with natural alignment  
**Impact:** Would cause panic/crash on strict-alignment architectures

#### Scenario 4: Invalid UTF-8 in C String
**Prevented by:** `CStr::to_str()` validation with error return  
**Result if check fails:** Returns `OmpStatus::InvalidUtf8` safely

#### Scenario 5: C String Not Null-Terminated
**Cannot prevent:** This is caller's responsibility (standard C contract)  
**Mitigation:** Documented in safety contract  
**Impact:** Could read beyond buffer (standard C string danger)

## Safety Guarantee Summary

### What We Guarantee:

1. ✅ **No undefined behavior from Rust code**
   - All unsafe blocks are minimal and audited
   - All pointer writes are guarded by NULL checks
   - All string reads validate UTF-8

2. ✅ **No memory leaks from Rust**
   - All resources owned by registry
   - Explicit free functions provided
   - No circular references possible

3. ✅ **No data races**
   - Registry protected by Mutex
   - Thread-local parse results
   - No shared mutable state

4. ✅ **Proper error handling**
   - All errors return status codes
   - NULL checks before all unsafe operations
   - UTF-8 validation on string input

### What We Cannot Guarantee:

1. ❌ **C caller follows contracts**
   - If C passes invalid pointer → crash (same as any C library)
   - If C passes non-null-terminated string → buffer overrun
   - If C has data race on output pointer → corruption

2. ❌ **C caller manages handles properly**
   - If C forgets to free → leak (like malloc/free)
   - If C uses freed handle → returns error (safe! won't crash)
   - If C uses wrong handle type → returns error (safe!)

**This is standard FFI:** We're as safe as the C/Rust boundary allows.
